  Julius Heinemann's practice is based on the study of the different layers of
  perception, understood as a key for the relationship between the subject and
  the other – an "other" that can also be called reality, society, world, etc.
  Heinemann analyses how perception forms "images" –fragments of continuously
  updated information from the outside– with which we can deal with concepts
  such as time and space, crucial for the articulation of these sensory
  relations.\

  \

  Through all his body of work, Heinemann formally researches the preconceived ways to interpret abstract values such as scale, colour, shape, and light in order to redefine strategies to understand, from a subjective position, our relationship with what surrounds us. This approach results in the creation of new models that create an archive of personal images.\

  \

  His drawings, paintings, installations, books, and other media the artist works with, as well the collaborations with other artists, focus on developing a new vocabulary, that allows him to face up to the instability and the flow of nowness; this constant state of becoming, grasping other temporal and spatial structures.\

  \

  Therefore, his works become the basis for a research on how to think out of normative ideas in all fields of knowledge; ideas which reverberate in the conception of history, science or politics. This continued attitude of questioning what we see in physical terms, is contemplated as a tool for thinking and feeling, and as an alternative way of imagining the possibilities of a collectivity derived from individual perceptions.
